# **Hospital and XR2 Deployment Analysis**

This project analyzes the geographic distribution of hospitals and XR2 robot deployments to identify coverage gaps and provide actionable recommendations for Omnicell. By integrating hospital data and XR2 deployment data, the analysis highlights regions with high potential for strategic expansion.

---

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Analyze Hospital Distribution:**
   - Examine the number of hospitals by state and region.
   - Identify high-density hospital areas.
2. **Evaluate XR2 Coverage:**
   - Highlight regions with minimal XR2 deployments.
   - Assess alignment between XR2 locations and hospital distribution.
3. **Provide Strategic Recommendations:**
   - Recommend deployment strategies for regions with significant coverage gaps.
   - Focus on actionable insights to support Omnicellâ€™s growth.
